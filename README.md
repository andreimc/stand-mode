### Mirror + Black out screen

I use this for my standing desk setup.

Install:

```
make

sudo make install

mirror

### to disable run command again

mirror
```

When you have another monitor plugged in it turns brigness to 0 on your laptop screen and sets up mirror, so basically your mac is a glorified keyboard.

Not sure how usefull this is for other people by. I use this for my ikea hack standing desk.
